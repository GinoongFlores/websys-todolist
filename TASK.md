# Todo Lists App Tasks

- [x] Create a TODO Lists App with the following features:
  - [x] User can Login, Logout and Register using Firebase Authentication and Save User Data in Firestore
  - [x] CRUD of TODO lists
  - [x] Simple UI/UX design
  - [x] Make sure we are using the Firebase Firestore docs https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore?hl=en&authuser=0

# Fixes/Issues

- [x] When we are on the register form page and click the login the form won't change into the login form. We need to refresh the page to see the login form.
- [x] On the form of login/register, there's a visible of div section of error color message in which we need to hide and we only show the error style when the user clicks the login/register button.

# Improvements

- [x] Separate the css styles and JavaScript code from the HTML file and put them in their own files for better organization and maintainability
- [x] Add a loading spinner when the user is waiting for the data to load from the database
- [x] Add a confirmation dialog when the user tries to delete a TODO list

Future Improvements:

- [ ] Add categories or tags for todo items
- [ ] Implement due dates for tasks
- [ ] Add task priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- [ ] Enable task sorting by different criteria (priority, due date, etc.)
- [ ] Add offline support using Firebase persistence
- [ ] Implement task sharing between users
- [ ] Add dark mode theme support

# Objectives

- [ ] Secure (users can only see their own TODO lists)
- [ ] Efficient lookups (use indexes) to speed up queries
- [ ] View newest TODO lists first

## How Index Works in Firebase in simple terms

Think of Firebase indexes like a book's index page! Just as a book's index helps you quickly find specific topics without reading the whole book, Firebase indexes help your app quickly find specific data without searching through everything.

Let's break it down:

- Without an index: Like trying to find a specific word by reading a whole book
- With an index: Like using a book's index page to jump straight to what you need

## Use Case

In our Todo Lists app, we need to:

1. Find tasks for a specific user (like finding all chapters written by one author)
2. Show newest tasks first (like sorting chapters by date)

Here's how it works in our app:

```javascript
// This query needs an index because it does two things at once:
query(
  collection(db, "todos"),
  where("userId", "==", userId), // First: Find your tasks
  orderBy("timestamp", "desc") // Then: Sort by newest first
);
```

## When to use Indexes

We use indexes in our Todo Lists app because:

1. üì± User Experience Needs:

   - Quick loading of tasks (nobody likes waiting!)
   - Show newest tasks first (like social media feeds)
   - Real-time updates (instant task changes)

2. üîç Search Pattern Needs:

   - Finding specific user's tasks AND sorting them
   - Just like Instagram showing YOUR posts in time order

3. üìä Data Size Considerations:
   - Many users with many tasks
   - Like a big library needing a catalog system

### Analogy

üè´ Think of a School Library:

1. Without Index (Bad):

   - Librarian checks EVERY book to find what you need
   - Takes forever as library grows bigger
   - Like searching todos without an index!

2. With Index (Good):
   - Library has a card catalog system
   - Can find books by author AND publication date
   - Just like our todos by userId AND timestamp!

üí° MySQL Connection:

- Just like MySQL's CREATE INDEX
- Both help speed up searches
- Both are crucial for larger datasets

## When to not use Indexes

Let's understand when indexes aren't needed, using real examples:

1. üéÆ Candy Crush Game Example:

```javascript
// Simple score save - No index needed!
await addDoc(collection(db, "scores"), {
  userId: currentUser.uid,
  level: 5,
  score: 1000,
});

// Simple score fetch - No index needed!
const scoreDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, "scores", scoreId));
```

2. üéØ Simple App Scenarios:

   - Single document lookups (getting one score)
   - Small data collections (few items)
   - No complex sorting needed

3. üì± Real Examples where Indexes aren't needed:
   - User profiles (direct document access)
   - Game settings (simple gets and updates)
   - Daily challenges (single document per day)

Remember: Start simple! Add indexes only when you need to search AND sort at the same time, just like our Todo Lists app! üöÄ
